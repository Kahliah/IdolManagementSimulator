# Set up
[Download compiled game files.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m9voiup7kkh3bqb/IdolManagementSim.zip?dl=0)
Download SQL Server Configuration Manager and SQL Server Management Studio.
In SQL Server Management Studio create a new Database named IdolDB, and two tables named Groups and Idols.

Optional: [Download my precreated tables](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dsk18zidb7yvqx3/IMS_DB.zip?dl=0), and import the csv files into their respective tables.

Also Option: [Download images](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m2vod8eepplfgr5/IMS_Images.zip?dl=0) for the idols in the precreated tables. Extract the images to the Resources folder found in the IdolManagementSim folder. If you do not do this you will have to manually add images for each idol in the database.

Edit the `connectionString` in the CONFIG file, found in the IdolManagementSim folder downloaded earlier, to the one created for your database, if neccessary.

Run the Idol Management Simulator exe to play. Add your own groups and images for each member by clicking the Menu button on the first screen.
